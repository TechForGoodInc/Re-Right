            "4.  the applicants, whose years of birth are summarised in the appendix, live in troitsko-pechorsk of the komi republic. 5.  they were municipal unitary enterprise employees working for “troitsko-pechorskoye zhkkh” («муп «троицко-печерское жкх», “the company”) in the komi republic. 6.  the company was set up in 2003 in accordance with a decision of head of the troitsko-pechorskiy district (“the district administration”) as a commercial organisation performing the following activities, among others: renovation and maintenance of the municipal housing stock; heating and water supply to the district population and enterprises; maintenance of the sewage systems; maintenance services in respect of municipal housing and adjacent territories; and providing real estate registration services in the troitsko-pechorskiy district. in order to carry out its statutory activities, the company had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it by the town administration (see liseytseva and maslov v. russia, nos. 39483/05 and 40527/10, §§ 55-75, 9 october 2014 for further details on the company’s status). 7.  in 2004-2006 the district administration withdrew the company’s several assets, including “housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure” and transferred them to the municipal district treasury. 8.  on the dates tabulated in the appendix below the justice of the peace of the troitsko‑pechorskiy court circuit of the komi republic by separate judgments and court writs ordered the company to pay the applicants salary arrears. on the dates listed in the appendix the awards became enforceable. 9.  it appears from the parties’ observations of 2011 that ms lyubas (application no. 10742/09) obtained at least two other judgments in her favour which had been issued on 22 june and 2 november 2007 against the debtor enterprise. 10.  between april 2007 and september 2008 some applicants received the amounts specified in the “enforcement status” column of the appendix. the government submitted, without further details, that ms lyubas was paid 56,021 russian roubles pursuant to unspecified domestic judicial decisions in her favour. ms lyubas, interviewed in the domestic proceedings, maintained that the award of 21 december 2006 had not been paid to her. 11.  on 11 december 2006 the supervision procedure was put in place in respect of the company. on 14 may 2007 the commercial court of the komi republic declared the company insolvent and the liquidation proceedings commenced. 12.  at some point before 9 november 2007 the prosecutor’s office conducted an inquiry and, having analysed the manner of the assets’ withdrawal and transfer by the owner, concluded that the owner’s actions contained elements of deliberate bankruptcy. it appears that at some point the prosecutor’s office refused to open criminal proceedings on account of the alleged deliberate bankruptcy of the company. in november 2007 the prosecutor’s office also held an inquiry into the liquidator’s actions, found that she had acted in compliance with the domestic law and refused to bring administrative proceedings against her. 13.  during the insolvency proceedings the liquidator lodged numerous actions on the company’s behalf claiming, inter alia, unpaid communal charges from local population. the amount recovered proved insufficient to settle all creditors’ claims. 14.  at some point the liquidator lodged an action on the company’s behalf against the district administration under article 56 § 3 (subsidiary liability) of the civil code of the russian federation. he argued that the insolvency of the company had been caused by the administration. he submitted that, as a result of a series of the asset transfers in 2004-2006, the company had become unable to meet the creditors’ claims and to continue to carry out its statutory goals. 15.  on 3 march 2010 the federal commercial court of the volgo‑vyatskiy circuit rejected the claim in the cassation instance, and on 12 july 2010 the supreme commercial court refused to accept for examination a request for supervisory review of that judgment. the domestic courts at all instances accepted that the assets had indeed been transferred from the company’s economic control to the district treasury. however, they found no evidence that the insolvency had been caused by the owner’s actions. in particular, after the withdrawal of assets the company still had been able to meet the creditors’ claims. the housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure on 30 january 2006 had been withdrawn “in order to apply the housing policy” and to “reduce the company’s expenses for the maintenance of the infrastructure objects”. in particular, the ministry of architecture and communal services of the komi republic had recommended the municipalities to withdraw objects of housing and engineering infrastructure from unitary enterprises in order to optimise taxes of housing and communal services providers. finally, even though at the insolvency stage the company proved unable to meet the creditors’ claims, the claimant had failed to demonstrate that the owner “knew or ought to have known that [the transfer of the assets] would have led to the company’s insolvency”. 16.   on 28 december 2011 the commercial court of the komi republic ordered the respondent company’s liquidation. creditors’ claims which had not been satisfied during the liquidation procedure due to the debtor’s shortage of funds, including the applicant’s claims, were considered as settled. on the same date the liquidation was recorded in the register of legal entities, and the company ceased to exist. the judgments in the applicants’ favour have remained unenforced either in full or in part, as indicated in a relevant part of the appendix below.\n",

            "4.  the municipal unitary enterprise sysolskoye proizvodstvennoye obyedineniye “zhilkomkhoz” (муп сысольское производственное объединение «жилкомхоз», hereinafter “the company”) was set up by a decision of the administration of the sysolskiy district. it provided maintenance services in respect of municipal housing, including heating and water supply, maintenance of the sewage systems and renovation and maintenance of the municipal housing stock. 5.  the company had “the right of economic control” (право хозяйственного ведения) over the assets allocated to it in order to carry out its statutory activities. according to its statutory articles all of the company’s property as well as obtained profits belonged to the municipal estate. 6.  on 3 march 2006 the commercial court of the komi republic commenced insolvency proceedings and appointed an external administrator to oversee the company’s administration. 7.  on 29 september 2006 the commercial court of the komi republic ordered the insolvency proceedings in respect of the company. 8.  on 28 august 2008 the commercial court of the komi republic discontinued the insolvency proceedings and ordered the respondent company’s liquidation. the creditors’ claims, which had not been satisfied during the liquidation procedure, including the applicants’ claims, were considered as settled. 10.  on an unspecified date in 2006 the applicants brought proceedings against the debtor company seeking salary arrears and other work-related payments. 11.  on 9 august 2006 and 30 october 2006 the justice of the peace of the sysolskiy court circuit of the komi republic awarded the applicants salary arrears (the amounts are specified in the appendix, column no. 2) and compensation for non-pecuniary damage against their employer. on 10 october 2006 and 10 november 2006 respectively the sysolskiy district court upheld those judgments on appeal and they became final.\n",

(also under article 302 of the criminal code, coercion to obtain statements), and four others. 35.  on 21 march 2005 a deputy prosecutor of the sovetskiy district prosecutor’s office overturned the investigator’s decision, as the inquiry on which it was based was considered incomplete, and ordered an additional inquiry.\n",
            "(d)  additional explanations received by the investigating authority 36.  investigator b. received the following additional explanations. 37.  on 22 march 2005 n., a medical assistant, stated that at 7.30 p.m. an ambulance had been called by police station no. 2. she and g., a junior nurse, had gone to the police station. she had found the applicant in a room with two police officers, who had explained to her that the applicant had hit the glass with his head and broken it. she had examined the applicant, who had cuts over the left eyebrow and on the head. her examination had not revealed any obvious signs of concussion. the applicant had taken off his clothes. she had not seen any visible injuries on his body. 38.  on 23 march 2005 junior nurse g. gave similar explanations. she noted that the applicant had been in a room with two police officers, one of whom had later come out. then medical assistant n. had examined the applicant. 39.  on 23 and 24 march 2005 ya. and v. stated that in february 2005 they had undergone in‑patient treatment at the town hospital and had been in the same ward as the applicant, who had told them that he had been ill‑treated at the police station. ya. understood that police officers had handcuffed the applicant and hung him and afterwards hit his head against the wall. according to v., police officers had handcuffed the applicant and hung him, and then either he himself had hit the bookcase with his head or police officers had hit his head against the bookcase. 40.  the applicant’s schoolteacher, i., characterised the applicant as sly, deceitful and shifty. 41.  forensic medical expert b. stated that he did not consider it possible to establish reliably how the applicant had received concussion. it could have been the result either of the applicant’s hitting the bookcase with his head or of being punched on the head.\n",
            "(e)  decision of 24 march 2005 42.  on 24 march 2005, on the basis of the results of the inquiry, investigator b. again refused to open a criminal case under article 24 § 1 (2) of the ccrp, on the grounds that the constituent elements of a crime in the acts of police officers sh., p., k., e. and four others were absent. as before, the investigator referred to a crime under article 286 of the criminal code (abuse of power), as well as article 301 of the criminal code (unlawful arrest or detention) in relation to sh., and article 302 of the criminal code (coercion to obtain statements) in relation to p., k. and e.. the investigator found that the applicant had been at the sovetskiy district police department from 11 a.m. until 3.20 p.m. on 15 february 2005 for an identity parade in a criminal case concerning assault and battery, and that at about 7 p.m. on the same day police officer e. had taken him to police station no. 2 on suspicion of theft. the investigator held that the results of the inquiry had showed that the applicant’s injuries were self-inflicted, as a result of his hitting the bookcase with his head, and that the allegations of ill-treatment by police officers were devoid of any foundation. 43.  the applicant’s father appealed against the investigator’s decision of 24 march 2005. he complained, in particular, that the investigator had never held an identity parade in order to identify the two unknown police officers who had delivered blows to the applicant’s head. 44.  on 20 may 2005 the orsk sovetskiy district court, sitting in a single-judge formation, heard the applicant’s father, his representative and a deputy prosecutor of the sovetskiy district prosecutor’s office, and examined the evidence of the inquiry carried out by the investigator. it was satisfied that the inquiry had been comprehensive and thorough, and that the investigator’s assessment of its results had been impartial, reasoned and logical. it dismissed the applicant’s father’s appeal. it noted that an identity parade could only be held once a criminal case had been opened, which was not the case in the present proceedings. 45.  the applicant’s father appealed against the district court’s decision. on 16 june 2005 the orenburg regional court dismissed his appeal and fully endorsed the first-instance court’s findings. it held, inter alia, that the evidence of the inquiry had reliably shown that on 15 february 2005 the applicant had not been arrested as a suspect in a criminal case.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  the applicant was born in 1960 and until his conviction lived in the town of slantsy in the leningrad region. 7.  in 1991 the applicant sustained a penetrating head injury, which involved the crushing of brain tissue. this trauma caused paralysis of the entire right side of his body, light speech impairment and post-traumatic epilepsy. to reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures the applicant was obliged to take benzonal. 8.  the following year the applicant was examined by a social security medical assessment board (бюро медико-социальной экспертизы) and certified as having the highest-degree disability on the grounds that he had lost the ability to work, to walk without assistance or to look after himself. those findings were confirmed by the board during routine re-examinations in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000, when the applicant was granted life-long disability status. 9.  in 2005 the applicant committed a homicide. on 16 april 2007 the slantsy town court found him guilty of murder and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment in a highly secure correctional colony. on 15 august 2007 the leningrad region court upheld the sentence on appeal. 10.  on 16 april 2007 the applicant was taken to a police ward in the town of slantsy. 11.  two days later he was transferred to remand prison no. iz-47/6 in st petersburg. on admission to that facility the resident prison doctor conducted a general medical check-up of the applicant and noted his disability. the applicant was allowed to take benzonal supplied by his wife in order to minimise his suffering from epileptic seizures. 12.  in the remand prison the applicant was detained in a normal cell block where he allegedly faced great difficulties in his daily routine owing to the lack of special arrangements, in particular when using the squat toilet and shared dormitory shower, which lacked handrails and non-slip flooring. 13.  on 26 september 2007, when the sentence became final, he was transferred to correctional colony no. 7 in the leningrad region, where he was also placed in a cell designed for healthy inmates and, allegedly, continued to experience the inconveniences arising from his disability. 14.  having no licence to treat inmates with as strong a medication as benzonal, the colony’s medical authorities offered the applicant two substitute drugs with similar anticonvulsive effect, but the latter refused, alleging their low efficiency and possible side effects. 15.  on 3 march 2008, at his own request, the applicant was sent to gaaza prison hospital in st petersburg (“the prison hospital”) for an in‑depth medical examination and treatment. in the hospital he was subjected to various medical tests which showed that his health was stable. on 1 april 2008 the applicant was discharged from the hospital. in the discharge summary the supervising doctor mentioned that the patient was able to look after himself and to walk without assistance. 16.  on 10 october 2008 the deputy head of the correctional colony ordered the applicant’s transfer to a special unit for disabled prisoners. according to the government’s description, this unit had “enhanced housing conditions” and “less strict security regime”. it accommodated only disabled inmates, who were detained in a prison wing located close to the medical unit. 17.  the applicant submitted that even after his transfer to the special unit he had not been provided with nursing assistance. being unable to dress himself or perform hygiene procedures without assistance, he had asked his inmates for help in exchanging valuable prison products such as tea, coffee, sweets and cigarettes. 18.  on 1 july 2009 the special medical board, at the request of the penal authorities, issued an advisory report confirming the gravity of the applicant’s disability. 19.  on 4 august 2009 the applicant was examined by a medical board composed of the prison hospital management and a neurosurgeon. the doctors noted that the applicant’s health had remained stable, that he was able to look after himself, and that nursing assistance was not required for him. however, due to the gravity of the applicant’s brain condition it was decided to check whether his illness fell within the established list of illnesses warranting early release. 20.  three days later a special medical board confirmed that the applicant’s condition justified his early release. 21.  it appears that the applicant remained in the prison hospital until 8 september 2009. 22.  in the meantime the detention authorities applied for his early release on medical grounds. 23.  on 28 august 2009 the smolninskiy district court of st petersburg dismissed their application, citing the gravity of the applicant’s offence, the fact that he had developed paralysis and epilepsy prior to his arrest and that in detention his condition had remained stable. the decision was upheld on appeal by the st petersburg city court on 17 november 2009. 24.  between 1 february and 18 march 2010, at his own request, the applicant was admitted to the prison hospital for treatment, and on 16 march 2010 he was re-examined by a medical board, which confirmed his right to early release on medical grounds. 25.  on 10 april 2010 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony no. 4 in the leningrad region. he was accommodated in a special unit for disabled prisoners. it appears that the conditions of his detention were similar to those in correctional colony no. 7. the applicant continued to receive benzonal from his wife and refused to take any substitutes. 26.  on 10 june 2010 the tosnenskiy town court dismissed the application for early release on medical grounds, referring to the gravity of the applicant’s offence, the fact that his health status had already been taken into account by the court which sentenced him, and, lastly, to the fact that the applicant’s medical condition had not worsened in detention.\n",
